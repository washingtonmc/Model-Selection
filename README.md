# Model-Selection
Akaike's Information Criterion vs Bayesian Information Criterion
This project was to examine the differences betweent two model selection techniques by looking at different aritcles and their results and also using both techniques on the same dataset.  I used the Heart dataset from the ISLR package from Introductions of Statistical Learning with R.  I have also uploaded that modiefied dataset, I used indicators for chest pains.
